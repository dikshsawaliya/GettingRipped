    <string name="pose1">       Step 1 : Begin by lying on your side, forearm down, knees slightly bent.\n\n
                                Step 2 : Roll slightly back onto your glute, like your sitting on the back pocket of your blue jeans and lift legs a few inches off the mat. Bring top hand behind the head so elbow is also bent.\n\n
                                Step 3 : Lift legs up bringing your knees to your elbow while at the same time crunching your elbow toward your knee. Squeeze your waistline with each lift. Perform desired number of reps and switch sides. \n\n

                                Step 3 : While exhaling your breath, crunch your abs in the forward right direction. Try to catch your right ankle with the right extended arm (step 2). Stay there till the count of one.\n\n
                                Step 4 : Now while youâ€™re inhaling your breath, leave the right ankle you caught hold of with your right arm and very slowly move back to the starting position.\n\n
                                Step 5 : Repeat the same for the left side.\n\n

                                Step 2: Keeping your legs stick straight and glued together with your toes pointed, start lowering one leg.\n\n
                                Step 3: Raise your lowered leg and lower the other, focusing on keeping your core engaged.\n\n
                                Step 4: Continue the movement, alternating between legs.\n\n

                                Step 2 : Place your hands on the ground beside you for support and lean back at a roughly 45 degree angle with your back straight.\n\n
                                Step 3 : Pull your belly button in towards your spine and raise your legs off the ground.\n\n

    <string name="pose5">       Step 1: Extend one leg from the hip so that your foot lifts off the mat a few inches.\n\n
                                Step 2: Your foot can point softly as it is released from the mat.\n\n
                                Step 3: As you extend your leg, your hip will lift slightly, but the challenge is to keep the rest of your body stable in plank position. \n\n
                                Step 4: This requires extra work from your abdominal, shoulders, and back.\n\n
